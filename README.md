Vocab Matching! is a little game we made to help
practice and memorize vocabulary! You can input any words
you like to practice any language like Spanish, German,
Japanese, and more!

In order to play this game we first need to import some vocab!
To do so, organize and list all the words you want to learn as
so:
First Word. Second Word;
Each matching pair has the first and second vocabulary words
seperated by a "," and then all the diffferent matches are
seperated by ";" and you can either have a space or line
break after the semicolon; however you want to organize it
(We personally like organizing with line breaks.) Here is the
demo list for example:

Glass, Vaso;
House, Casa;
Hello, Hola;
Computer, Ordenadoe;
Rat, Rata;

NOTE: the buttons are optimized for about 15 or 16 letters long,
more will still work, it just might make the buttons taller than
normal. Also it only supports 2 words per match, if you do something
like: Consada, consado, tired;, it wont work and will not show up
in the buttons/game. Also make sure to avoid duplicates as it may
break the matching logic (were trash at coding sorry aaaa.)

Timer: by default its set to 60, however you can click in the box
and change it to whatever seconds you like. Normally we like to do
1.5 seconds per match, so 30 seconds for 20 matches, 60 for 40 matches,
so on and so forth, but do as much as your heart desires :3

Once you put in your vocab and however long you like click Start!

HOW TO PLAY: the matches will be mixed on on left and right so you
dont get too hung up on one language or the other, just click one
of the words and click the correct translated word on the other side!

At the end you will be given an overall score, how many you got right
how many you got wrong, and a list of words that you had trouble with
obviosly in the same format as the input so you can copy and paste
them back into the input if you would like to retry those words later.
